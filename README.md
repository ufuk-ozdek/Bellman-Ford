# Bellman-Ford Python Implementation
Given a graph and a starting vertex s in graph, find shortest paths from s to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. 
If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.

# Time Complexity
Time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE)
